# Internet-Tester-Python
An internet tester that will print the connection speed into console.

How to use it?
Open the executable and let it run as long as you want, it will calculate the internet speed and print it into console every 5 minutes.
After you have all your data on the console, open Excel.py, paste all your results into a notepad called data and have both in the same folder.
Execute the code and it should generate an Excel where you can now analyze your internet connection over time.

What's the executable code?
Is the tester.py, I just used a Python compilator.

Could this be done better in C++?
yes, absolutely. I just found it easier with Python.

Can I fix/add stuff?
yes, make a new branch and a pull request and there we can discuss the changes.
